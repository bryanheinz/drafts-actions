## Markdown to Dokuwiki
### Numbered lists
This converter treats '-' as ordered lists and '*' as unordered lists.

I dislike the use of numbers for ordered lists in markdown unless I'm actually referencing the raw markdown. I find it really annoying when i have to rearrange an ordered list. This is my biggest (only?) gripe with Gruber's original markdown syntax - that he gave unordered lists two ways to be defined, but only gave ordered lists the numbered option.
